# Choosing Native App Development

## Status
We are proposing to develop the application in a native app environment.

## Context
The client wants to create a new mobile application for their retail company.

## Decision 
The team have decided to create the application in a native application environment to allow a high quality user experience and for better performance. Due to the client's requirements for offline mode and push notification, a native app is well suited for the project.

## Consequences
Two versions of the application would have to be created, one for android and one for iOS. This would increase development cost, and require more careful plannign to ensure the iOS app store's guidelines are followed to ensure approval process is passed.
