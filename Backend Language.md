# Choosing the backend language

## Status
We are proposing on which backend language to use to develop the mobile application.

## Context
The backend language is what keeps the app running on the server-side. It handles a lot of the aspects of the application whihc include data storage, synchronization, user authentication, and interaction with third-party services.

## Decision
Java would be used for the backend language of the app.

## Consequences
Some learning curve is to be expected if a few members of the team are not used to Java which could initially affect development speed.
