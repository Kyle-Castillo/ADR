# Choosing UI framework

## Status
We are proposing to develop the application's UI frameworks. We would develop the app using the SwiftUI framework for iOS and React Native for Android.

# Context
To develop a mobile application for the retail company, a UI framework has to be chosen. Considerations have to be made for an excellent user experience. We also have to ensure that their is cross-platform compatability, and that we can leverage development resources effectively.

# Decision
We have decided to use Swirft UI to develop the iOS application.
We have decided to use React Native to develop the Android Application.

# Consequences
Due to developing on two different frameworks more effort will be required to develop platform-specific UI components. More complexity is inroduced to both develop an maintain seperate Ui components for iOS and Android, but modern development tool may help lessen this issue.
